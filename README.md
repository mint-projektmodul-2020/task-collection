# MINT Projektmodul 2020 - Task Collection

### Chapter 1 - Basic Electrical Engineering
Get to know the **fundamentals of eletricity** and learn how 
to plan out, calculate and measure **small electronic circuits**
<br/><br/>

### Chapter 2 - Basic Arduino
Learn about **starting with Arduino**: What it is, how to set it 
up and how to program it. Afterward learn about **basic methods
and commands** to start making your Arduino do whatever you want.
<br/><br/>

### Chapter 3 - Basic Programming
Dive a bit deeper into programming and its concepts. Learn about
**data structures**, **arithmetics**, **conditial execution**, 
**loops** and **functions**.
<br/><br/>

### Chapter 4 - Applied Arduino
Use your gathered skills to connect your Arduino to a selection
of various sensors, actuators and displays. We only cover a few
selected parts: **Distance sensor (ultrasonic)**, **joystick**,
**stepper motor**, **servo motor**, **LCD**, **7-segment display**.

However the methods are the same for nearly every other Arduino 
part you can get.
